# Animal Speech Generation Integration

The `generateAnimalSpeech.js` module has been successfully integrated into the existing project structure.

## What Was Created/Modified

### 1. New Files Created
- `src/utils/generateAnimalSpeech.js` - The core speech generation module
- `src/components/AnimalCard.jsx` - Component that uses the speech generation
- `src/components/AnimalDemo.jsx` - Demo page to showcase the feature
- `public/sounds/README.md` - Instructions for adding animal sound files
- `ENVIRONMENT_SETUP.md` - Environment variable setup guide
- `ANIMAL_SPEECH_INTEGRATION.md` - This integration guide

### 2. Modified Files
- `src/App.jsx` - Added route for `/animal-demo` and navigation link

## How It Works

### 1. AnimalCard Component
When a user clicks on an animal in `AnimalCard.jsx`:

1. **Immediate Sound Playback**: Plays the preloaded animal sound from `/public/sounds/`
2. **GPT Text Generation**: Calls Azure OpenAI to generate a friendly line
3. **TTS Conversion**: Converts the text to speech using Azure Speech Service
4. **Display & Playback**: Shows the generated text and plays the speech audio

### 2. Speech Generation Flow
```
User Click → Animal Sound → GPT Text → TTS Audio → Display + Play
```

### 3. State Management
- `generatedText` - Stores the GPT-generated text
- `isGenerating` - Shows loading state while processing

## Setup Requirements

### 1. Environment Variables
Create a `.env` file in your project root:
```bash
REACT_APP_AZURE_AI_FOUNDRY_KEY=your_azure_ai_foundry_key
REACT_APP_GPT_ENDPOINT=your_gpt_endpoint_url
REACT_APP_TTS_ENDPOINT=your_tts_endpoint_url
```

### 2. Animal Sound Files
Animal sounds are automatically loaded from the paths defined in `public/config/farm.json`:
- **Cow**: `animals/cow/moo.mp3`
- **Pig**: `animals/pig/oink.mp3`
- **Goat**: `animals/goat/baa.mp3`
- **Sheep**: `animals/sheep/baa.mp3`
- **Hen**: `animals/hen/cluck.mp3`
- **Horse**: `animals/horse/neigh.mp3`

**Note**: The `/public/sounds/` directory is no longer used. Sounds are loaded from the existing animal folder structure.

### 3. Restart Development Server
After adding the `.env` file, restart your React development server.

## Usage

### 1. Access the Demo
Navigate to `/animal-demo` in your app to see the AnimalCard components.

### 2. Test the Feature
Click on any animal to:
- Hear the animal sound immediately
- See GPT-generated text appear below the image
- Hear the AI-generated speech

### 3. Integration Points
The `AnimalCard` component can be used anywhere in your app by:
```jsx
import AnimalCard from './components/AnimalCard';

<AnimalCard 
  animalName="Cow" 
  onAnimalClick={(name) => console.log(`${name} clicked`)} 
/>
```

## Technical Details

### 1. API Calls
- **Azure AI Foundry**: Uses unified endpoint for both GPT and TTS
- **GPT**: Uses `gpt-4o-mini` model for text generation
- **TTS**: Uses neural voices for high-quality speech synthesis
- **Unified Authentication**: Single key and endpoint for all services

### 2. Voice Mapping
- **English**: Uses region-specific neural voices (US, UK, AU)
- **Hindi**: Uses Indian neural voices
- **Fallback**: Defaults to `en-US-JennyNeural` if no specific voice found

### 3. Error Handling
- Graceful fallback if APIs fail
- User-friendly error messages
- Prevents multiple simultaneous requests

## Testing Checklist

- [ ] Environment variables are set in `.env`
- [ ] Animal sound MP3 files are in their respective folders under `/public/animals/<animal_name>/`
- [ ] Development server has been restarted
- [ ] Navigate to `/animal-demo`
- [ ] Click on different animals
- [ ] Verify animal sounds play immediately
- [ ] Verify GPT text appears below images
- [ ] Verify TTS audio plays after generation
- [ ] Check browser console for any errors

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **"Cannot read property of undefined"** - Check environment variables
2. **Audio not playing** - Verify sound files exist in the correct animal folders and match the paths in `farm.json`
3. **GPT/TTS errors** - Check API keys and region settings
4. **CORS issues** - Ensure APIs are accessible from your domain

### Debug Steps
1. Check browser console for error messages
2. Verify `.env` file is in project root
3. Confirm API keys are valid and have proper permissions
4. Test API endpoints directly if needed

## Future Enhancements

- Language selection (currently hardcoded to "en")
- Voice customization options
- Caching for generated speech
- Offline fallback options
- Integration with existing Animal components
